## AWS

My IP address is: BLANK
Launching my AMI I initially put it on a private subnet. Even though it had a public IP address and the security group was right, I wasn't able to connect to it.

## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the [instruction]([[https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md](https://byu.instructure.com/courses/32210/pages/caddy)](https://byu.instructure.com/courses/32210/pages/https-tls-and-certificates)).

## HTML

This was not hard, but it was interesting to learn the proper structure and then reimplement everything using industry standards. Moving from plain HTML to a more organized architectural mindset helped clarify how content should be delivered to the user.

## CSS

Reimplementing the styling wasn't difficult, but it was a great exercise in following modern standards for responsiveness. Starting with basic CSS and moving toward a professional look ensured the application remained clean across different screen sizes.

## JavaScript

I spent a lot of time making the website fully functional and adding the necessary APIs to ensure the frontend connects seamlessly to my database. This layer handles all the core logic, such as recipe and ingredient management, that makes the application more than just a static page.

## React Part 1: Routing

Setting up React was simple. It was very interesting to take the original plain HTML structure and rebuild it into a more professional component-based system using routing.

## React Part 2: Reactivity

Although it was hard to see everything not working in the beginning, and getting used to using components took some time, it was rewarding to see how I could modify the original CSS, HTML, and JS to work properly within the React framework. I focused on ensuring the state management aligned with industry standards for user reactivity.
